SIMPyOn
=======

SIMPyOn is a free and open-source software to efficiently setup SIMION simulations
It simplifies the interaction with SIMION by providing Python API to generate the relevant files required by the program. It provides:

* a set of classes that can be used to make gem files, pa files, fly files
* a set of command to launch simion fly, refine potential arrays, fast-adjust voltages
* an optimization routine to efficiently find the best voltages
* a dedicated class to load and plot the data resulting from SIMION simulations
